ShadowFox Virtual Internship Report

1. Introduction
I successfully completed the ShadowFox Virtual Internship Program in the domain of Machine Learning.
The internship spanned one month and was designed to enhance practical skills by working on real‑world data science and machine learning problems.
The program was divided into three levels:
Beginner Level – Introductory projects to build foundational skills.
Intermediate Level – More complex projects requiring deeper understanding of machine learning workflows.
Advanced Level – Real‑time projects and industry‑relevant problem solving (optional).

I have successfully completed both the Beginner and Intermediate levels during this internship.

2. Objectives
The main objectives of my internship were to:
Gain hands‑on experience in data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, and feature engineering.
Learn and implement machine learning algorithms for predictive modeling.
Improve problem‑solving skills in a realistic data science environment.
Apply industry‑standard tools and libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, scikit‑learn, and Matplotlib.

3. Beginner Level Task
Project: Boston House Price Prediction
Description:
The task involved predicting house prices using the Boston Housing Dataset. The project helped me understand the fundamentals of:
Loading and exploring datasets using Pandas.
Identifying and handling missing values.
Building and training a Linear Regression model.
Evaluating the model using RMSE and R² score.

Outcome:
I successfully developed a regression model that could predict house prices based on features such as crime rate, average number of rooms, property tax rate, etc.

4. Intermediate Level Task
Project: Loan Approval Prediction using Machine Learning
Description:
The intermediate‑level task involved predicting whether a loan application should be approved based on applicant details such as gender, marital status, dependents, education, employment status, income, loan amount, credit history, and property area.
Key Steps Performed:
Data Cleaning & Preprocessing
Handled missing values in both numerical and categorical features.
Encoded categorical variables using Label Encoding.
Feature Scaling
Applied StandardScaler to normalize feature values for better model convergence.
Model Training & Evaluation
Used Logistic Regression to classify applications into approved/not approved categories.
Evaluated using Accuracy, Confusion Matrix, and Classification Report.

Outcome:
Achieved an accuracy of around 80-85% on the test dataset, with balanced performance across both classes.

5. Skills Acquired
During this internship, I improved my skills in:
Python programming for data science.
Data preprocessing (handling missing values, encoding, scaling).
Machine learning modeling using scikit‑learn.
Model evaluation and interpretation.

Problem‑solving in real‑world datasets.

6. Tools & Technologies Used
Python 3
Pandas, NumPy – Data manipulation
scikit‑learn – Machine learning models and preprocessing
Matplotlib / Seaborn – Data visualization
Jupyter Notebook / VS Code – Development environment

7. Conclusion
The ShadowFox Virtual Internship provided me with valuable experience in machine learning and data analysis. By completing the Beginner and Intermediate level tasks, I gained a deeper understanding of predictive modeling and real‑world problem‑solving.

This internship has strengthened my ability to work with data, build predictive models, and interpret results effectively, preparing me for more advanced projects in the field of Data Science and AI.
